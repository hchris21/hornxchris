        March 2020 - Present: Fullstack Web Engineer at Travelport (via
        Outsourcing Company)
      </h2>
      Embarking on a journey through the dynamic travel industry, I've had the
      privilege of steering the development of a groundbreaking Point of Sale
      web application. At the heart of this venture, I've immersed myself in the
      art of fullstack engineering, working hand-in-hand with diverse teams and
      weaving together the intricate threads of micro-frontend and
      micro-services architecture.
      <h3>🌍 Navigating the Nexus of Functionality and Aesthetics 🌍</h3>
      Collaboration is the heartbeat of innovation. As a bridge between Product
      Management, UI/UX engineers, and development managers, I've orchestrated
      symphonies of creativity and feasibility. I've danced through discussions
      with Product Owners, ensuring that every feature requirement harmonizes
      with our overarching goals. I've donned the hat of a design advocate,
      partnering with UI/UX engineers to weave user-centric aesthetics into the
      fabric of functionality.
      <h3>🏗️ Architecting the Future, One Feature at a Time 🏗️</h3>
      In the realm of web engineering, each feature is a masterpiece waiting to
      be painted. Armed with a keen eye for detail and a strategic mindset, I've
      analyzed feature requirements with forensic precision. With each stroke of
      my keyboard, I've crafted meticulous technical designs that seamlessly
      integrate into our existing architecture. The art of integration isn't
      just about code – it's about creating a symphony of services that dance in
      harmony.
      <h3>🎯 Decomposing Dreams into Achievable Milestones 🎯</h3>
      The roadmap to innovation is paved with smaller stones – each a story
      waiting to be told. I've embraced the challenge of breaking down grand
      visions into tangible milestones. Armed with my toolkit of analytical
      skills and a dash of creativity, I've turned intricate features into a
      mosaic of small, achievable stories, each a stepping stone towards
      excellence.
      <h3>🌱 Cultivating Excellence through Development Methodologies 🌱</h3>
      In my realm, quality isn't an afterthought; it's the guiding star. With
      the banners of Behaviour Driven and Test Driven Development unfurled, I've
      embarked on the quest for perfection. Each line of code is not just a
      creation but a testament to the power of precision. Through the crucible
      of development methodologies, I've not just crafted code – I've crafted
      assurance, resilience, and user delight.
      <h3>🌐 A Global Expedition of Teams 🌐 </h3>
      As the tides of projects ebb and flow, I've had the privilege of sailing
      with teams of diverse cultural backgrounds. With each new horizon, I've
      adapted swiftly, imbibing the strengths of each culture into the fabric of
      our collaboration. In the waves of diversity, I've found unity – a unity
      that fuels our pursuit of excellence.
      <h3>🌟 Guiding the Next Generation of Innovators 🌟 </h3>
      As a core member of my current team, I've embraced a mantle of mentorship.
      Guiding junior colleagues isn't just about imparting knowledge; it's about
      igniting the spark of innovation. With each mentorship session, I empower
      fellow engineers to tread the path of progress, fostering an environment
      where growth isn't just a goal – it's a way of life.
